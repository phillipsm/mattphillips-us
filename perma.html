        <h2>Perma</h2>
        <p>
            In this case study we'll walk through the process used to define the interface that displays web archives at Perma.cc.
        </p>
        <p>
            Perma.cc is a popular web service that helps scholars, journals, courts, and others create permanent records of the web sources they cite.
        </p>
        <p>
            This feature was implemented in 2017 in the Harvard Library Innovation Lab in Cambridge, MA.
            Create your own web archives at <a href="https://perma.cc" target="_blank">Perma.cc</a>.

      <div class="context-text">
          <p>
              Perma's core service is simple - input a URL and receive an archive in return. Your archive is stored at an academic or public library and is available forever. No more 404s!
          </p>
          <p>
              I played the roles of Interaction Designer, Full Stack Developer and Product Designer on the Perma team from 2013 to 2017. I led the design process described below.

    <div class="problem-text">
        <p>
          Presenting an archive of a webpage is a fine balance - you want give the maximum view to the archive replay, but need to make it clear that the visuals and text being displayed are a snapshot from another website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Find the fine line.

        <p>
          The interface we arrived at uses a thin blue header with a couple of dropdown panels to house admin control and archive metadata. Here's <a href="https://perma.cc/ANH9-VZXH" target="_blank">an example of an archive</a> I created from a Wikipedia page.
        </p>
        <p>
          We found that first-time users could quickly navigate and comprehend this pattern. And, it met our engineering requirements of being efficient across devices and displays.

        This process is an iterative one. It guides us through a broad range of paths forward and helps avoid arriving at a local maximum.
        </p>
        <p>
          The core thing we're doing here is turning up the variance. We want to produce a large volume of wild ideas and then cull the set.
        </p>
        <p>
            This process can be widely applied to software and hardware enhancements. It's served me well for many years over many efforts.

            Gather two to a few team members around a table and quickly pitch the problem to be solved. Facilitate a workshop that guides multiple lightening rounds to produce many different design ideas and directions.
          </p>
        <p>
            You'll generate mostly bad ideas, with a few potential gems mixed in. It's important to keep a light mood that's freewheelin', one that resembles an improv comedy performance.

        <p>
            We'll nominate a participant from the previous step and ask them, with group guidance, to tape or pin the cards to a surface. We're hoping to generate several groupings of cards that have shared energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're still adding and expanding in this step. Continue to suspend disbelief and avoid discussing technical implementations.

        <p>
          We've reached the middle of the process and now we start to narrow our focus. It's time for the Interaction Designer (me in this case) to produce a sets of wireframes from the generated ideas, with influence from prior art and known best practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wireframes can be drawn at different zoom levels - from just one little pop-up menu to a complete flow of screens. Stick to pencil and paper to convey the current low-fidelity, "just an idea," status of the interface.

          We should now be zeroing in on a couple promising paths - ideas we can refine with power users, testers and internal team members that thoroughly understand the patterns of the customer base.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case of this Perma feature, we arrived here with two potential interfaces and we needed help. We organized a handful of early adopters and mocked up interactions with them through medium-fidelity wireframes.
        </p>
        <p>
            This step not only stress tests potential directions, it aligns the broader team on a narrowing set of flows and screens.

          As we ship this feature, let's grab another task in the queue. In the case of Perma, we found that once users could generate and view web archives, they wanted to organize the pile of links they'd created.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, another journey starts with step one and the question of, "what type of admin interface will best support the user as they organize their archives?"

            I was fortunate to build Perma with a team of eight amazing people - one visionary faculty member, one project manager, one UI designer, one communications person and three full stack developers.

        <p>
          I played the roles of Interaction Designer, Full Stack Developer and Product Designer for this feature, and globally on the Perma team from 2013 to 2017. I led the process described above.
